# LeetCode 1470 â€“ Shuffle the Array

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Description

You're given an array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements.  
The array is structured like this:

[x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn]


The goal is to return a new array in the form:

[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]


So you're basically **"shuffling" the array** by alternating one value from the first half and one from the second half.



## ðŸ§  Example Explanation

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```python
nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3

This means:

x1 = 2, x2 = 5, x3 = 1
y1 = 3, y2 = 4, y3 = 7

Result: [2,3,5,4,1,7]

##  What I Learned
 
- Since Iâ€™m a beginner, I used ChatGPT as a helper to solve my first LeetCode problems  
- But I made sure to understand every line, run the code locally, and learn from the explanation  
  â†’ Iâ€™m using it as a learning tool, not just to copy code

My goal is to become more independent with every problem.
